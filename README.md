# React-Minesweeper

This is a MineSweeper Game.

To play: https://shirelb.github.io/react-minesweeper

### Instructions
The purpose of the game is to open all the cells of the board which do not contain a bomb. 

You lose if you set off a bomb cell.

Every non-bomb cell you open will tell you the total number of bombs in the eight neighboring cells. 
Once you are sure that a cell contains a bomb, you can push shift and click to put a flag on it as a reminder. 

Once you have flagged all the bombs correctly, you win.

To set the configurations of the board, just slide the bar to the desired number of the width, height or mines and start a new game.
To start a new game (abandoning the current one), just click on the "New Game" button.

Toggle to Superman mode to reveals the location of the flags. 

Happy mine hunting!
